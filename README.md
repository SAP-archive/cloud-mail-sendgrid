## Using Sendgrid on HCP example##

This repository contains examples of applications that use Sendgrid (APIs and Java Library) for transactional email capabilities and can be deployed on the HANA Cloud Platform.

There are two applications, one using [Sendgrid's APIs](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/index.html) and the other one using [Sendgrid's Java Library](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-java). 

For a quick start, clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/SAP/cloud-mail-sendgrid.git`

Then go to each of the folder and read the descriptions in the respective **readme.md** files to learn more about their usage. For a detailed explanation of the code, please follow the [wiki](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-mail-sendgrid/wiki).
